# useeio.js
`useeio.js` is a JavaScript client API for the [USEEIO
API](https://github.com/USEPA/USEEIO_API) that runs in the browser. It is written in TypeScript and uses [rollup.js](https://rollupjs.org) with the [typescript2 plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rollup-plugin-typescript2) to create a single UMD bundle; [terser](https://terser.org/) is then used to create a minified bundle.

## Usage

`useeio.js` is not on `npmjs.org` yet but you can just install it from Github directly:

	npm install git+https://github.com/USEPA/useeio.js.git

Alternatively, you can download and build it locally.
Warning: We are avoiding this currently since the `dist` folder gets deleted. An [issue has been posted](https://github.com/USEPA/useeio.js/issues/2).

You can contribute to the javascript in our [footprint](footprint) folder without building.

`npm ci` (clean install) is similar to `npm install`, but doesn't modify the package-lock.json. If dependencies in the package lock do not match those in package.json, npm ci will exit with an error, instead of updating the package lock.  If you're upgrading, npm install will make a lot of changes in package-lock.json.

To build, run the followin in the useeio.js folder.

	npm ci
	npm run build



## Dump API data locally
This project contains a script for downloading a JSON dump of an USEEIO-API instance:

	node scripts/dumpjson.js --endpoint {URL}

Where `{URL}` is some API endpoint. Formerly https://smmtool.app.cloud.gov/api.
If the API requires a key, append --apikey [Add API key here]
You can [register for an API key](https://github.com/USEPA/USEEIO_API/wiki/Use-the-API) via the US EPA's contact link.

You can then host the json files locally, e.g. via [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server).  
The 50 state json files are also pre-generated for you at [https://model.earth/OpenFootprint/impacts](https://model.earth/OpenFootprint/impacts)


```bash
# just install it once, globally
npm install http-server -g

# host the data folder on port 8080, allowing CORS
http-server ./data -p 8080 --cors

# Alternative
http-server ../OpenFootprint/impacts/2020 -p 8080 --cors
```
